## Overview

The Daily Schedule App is a productivity‑focused web application designed to help users efficiently plan, organize, and track tasks throughout the week. The app allows users to select any day and quickly view scheduled activities in a structured format, making it easy to stay organized and maintain a balanced workload. By providing a clear visual overview of daily responsibilities, the application supports users in managing their time more effectively.

Users can add tasks to specific hours of the day and include descriptions to keep track of important details. The system supports full task management through editing and deleting options, ensuring that schedules remain flexible and up to date. Color‑coding lets users visually categorize tasks—such as work, personal, or academic—so the schedule is easier to interpret at a glance. A dashboard view provides an organized presentation of tasks for either a single day or the entire week.

To support accessibility and convenience, the app includes options to save schedules locally or print a physical copy for offline use. Its user‑friendly interface allows smooth navigation between days and quick access to task creation and updates. The goal of PlanSimple is to offer an intuitive, efficient, and visually structured tool that helps users manage day‑to‑day tasks and improve productivity.
